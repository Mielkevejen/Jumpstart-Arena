# Jumpstart-Arena
A simple script to build jumpstart decks on MtG Arena

The script "ChooseDeck.py" should be run. It is written in Python and requires the packages "pyperclip", "random", and "listdir".
The input is the amount of boosters that should be in the deck. (The standard amount is 2, but more may be added, should one want to play 60-card decks or more.)
It automatically copies the deck to clipboard, so it may be imported on MtG Arena.

The folder "JumpStartDecks" contains deck found on "https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Jumpstart" (on 14.11.2020) with the relevant cards replaced to make the deck playable on MtG Arena.
New boosters can be added if they are formated the same way. (The script looks for all .txt files in that folder.) Boosters may of course also be deleted.

Have fun!
